    "**Welcome** to the MLB Analytics Dashboard. This notebook is a data-driven exploration which brings together multiple sources of baseball data to discover insights into player performance, salary efficiency, and injury trends over time. By integrating WAR, financial data, and injury reports with player demographic information, we can get a holistic view of the modern game of baseball while learning a little (or hopefully a lot) about data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview:\n",
    "**Data Integration:**\n",
    "- We will merge diverse datasets, including:\n",
    "  - *Batting and Pitching Statistics:* season-level performance data\n",
    "  - *Salary Information*: detailed financial data on player contracts\n",
    "  - *Advanced Metrics (WAR):* our primary quantitative measure of player perfomance\n",
    "  - *Demographic Data:* player names and birth years fron the Lahman database\n",
    "  - *Injury Reports:* injury data that reveal patterns in player health year over year\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Motivations:**\n",
    "1. *Pitch Percentage Mix Analysis:*\n",
    "   - Explore through basic interactive charting through single year pitch type selection or trends over time\n",
    "2. *Injury Analysis by Age and Position:*\n",
    "   - Analyze injury trends using interactive visualizations like boxplots, violin plots, time series line plots, and grouped bar charts\n",
    "   - Understand how injuries differ between pitchers and position players and how age influences types and frequency of injury eventes\n",
    "   - Investigate monthly trends in injuries to expose seasonal patterns and long term shifts\n",
    "3. *War vs Salary Analysis:*\n",
    "   - Explore translation of salary investments into on-field performance\n",
    "   - Spotlight both players who demonstrate exceptional value and those who demonstrate the sinkhole their contracts have become on their teams\n",

    "## Visualization Library Choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Seaborn\n",
    "Seaborn is a Python data visualization library that runs on Matplotlib. It is open source and freely available on GitHub. You can install it easily in the notebook using pip:\n",
    "`!pip install seaborn`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Seaborn?**\n",
    "- *Ease of Use:* Simplifies creation of appealing statistical graphics with less coding\n",
    "- *Integration:* Works seamlessly in Jupyter notebook environment\n",
    "- *Declarative Style:* Uses mostly a declarative approach which allows users to specify what they want to see without having to conduct extensive procedural programming\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Not Seaborn?**\n",
    "- It's less customizable than lower-level libraries like Matplotlib\n",
    "- Works best for static visualizations because of limited funcationality with interactivity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plotly\n",
    "Plotly is an interactive visualization library for Python, and it's an open source project. You can install it in the notebook using pip just like Seaborn:\n",
    "`!pip install plotly`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Plotly?**\n",
    "- *Interactivity:* Enables zooming, hovering, and selecting data points dynamically\n",
    "- *Web Integration:* Embeds directly into web apps which is ideal for interactive dashboards\n",
    "- *Both Declarative and Procedural:* Offers both declarative methods with Plotly Express and procedural methods with Plotly Graph Objects\n",
    "- *Jupyter Compatibility:* Integrates fully into Jupyter notebook environment, providing interactive visual feedback immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Not Plotly?**\n",
    "- A little more intricate to code with, making it steeper of a learning curve than working with something like Seaborn\n",
    "- May require additional resources to render interactive plots smoothly, especially with large sets of data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can We Use Both?**\n",
    "- *We can and we will!* Using both of these libraries together allows us to leverage the strengths of each so our plots are even more effective and expressive\n",
    "  - We will use Seaborn for exploratory static visualizations and plotly for the detailed, interactive, exploratory, and explanatory dashboards"

    "# MLB Pitch Usage Breakdown and Analysis: A Step by Step Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective: Basic Plot\n",
    "- **Explore** how pitch usage in the MLB has evolved over time between 2015-2024\n",
    "- **Build** an interactive chart using plotly to visualize the mixed percentage of pitch types thrown across seasons\n",
    "- **Understand** season-level performance by incorporating StatCast metrics when hovering over a single season pitch percentage bar, or dot on the pitch-type/year/type-percentage time series plot\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Source:\n",
    "- `stats_pitchers_all.csv`: contains season level pitch count data for all pitch types accounted for during the StatCast era\n",
    "  - We're focusing on completed seasons, so 2015-2024 as of the writing of this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What We Will Learn Making Our Plot:\n",
    "**How To:**\n",
    "1. Load and filter data from datasets\n",
    "2. Transform the data into a usable format - we will need our data in the long format for this chart\n",
    "3. Calculate the percentages of each pitch type thrown per season\n",
    "4. Create an interactive chart using plotly and ipywidgets to enable the viewer to flip back and forth between single-season bar charts and multi-season line charts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where We'll Go Afterward:\n",
    "**Advance** our skills gained from making this chart to dive deeper into more intricate charts, using more data, to deliver more interesting insights"

    "   - The **boxplot** and **violin plot** visualilzations provide us a clear view of how player ages at time of injury vary across different injury categories and between the position groups we defined (pitchers vs position players)\n",
    "   - These plots highlighted the medians and the spread of ages for the discrete injury categories\n",
    "2. *Yearly Injury Trends:*\n",
    "   - The **grouped bar chart** allowed us to dig into the weeds a bit by breaking down the injury counts yearly and by injury category\n",
    "   - Also included detailed statistical insights such as median age and mean age at injury for each category\n",
    "3. *Monthly Injury Trends:*\n",
    "   - The **monthly time series line chart** showed how injury events have evolved over time on a month-to-month basis\n",
    "   - We can also gain insight into seasonal patterns and shifts in injury frequencies by visualizing monthly trends"

    "1. *Integrate* multiple data sources (batters, pitchers, people, WAR, salary) to explore the interplay between salary and performance\n",
    "2. *Compare* team performance and league-wide trends to highlight differences in efficiency and identify potential contract sinkholes\n",
    "3. *Filter* stats-based insights by running the analysis for all positions, for pitchers, or for position players\n",
    "4. *Enable* seasonal measurement granularity by allowing the user to analyze statistics for individual seasons or the combined statistics over all seasons\n",
    "5. *Spotlight* standout or underperforming players based on salary values relative to WAR\n",
    "6. *Incorporate* an interactive legend and filter controls which allow age-groupings to be filtered on or off for the user\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are we going to try to find out?**\n",
    "1. How to teams and the league overall compare when converting salary into player performance?\n",
    "   - Can we identify efficiency benchmarks or warning signs between varying roles and ages leading to great deal or a multi-million dollar contract sinkhole?\n",
    "2. How does player age influence the dynamics of salary and performance?\n",
    "   - How might we identify trends in longevity and performance and pivot team strategy for roster makeup?\n",

    "# Conclusion: Insights and Future Directions in MLB Analytics\n",
    "As we wrap up this dashboard project, before we look ahead, lets take a quick look back and what we've accomplished here. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Insights:\n",
    "1. **Comprehensive Data Integration:**\n",
    "   - We merge batting, pitching, salary, WAR, and demographic data to create a unified dataset that offers a complete picture of MLB player performance and financial dynamics\n",
    "   - This integration allowed us to correlate player performance with salary and health measurements\n",
    "2. **WAR vs Salary:**\n",
    "   - Our interactive chart revealed serious trends in how teams successfully or unsuccessfully invest in talent\n",
    "   - This study highlighted standout, or \"spotlight\", players and potential contract inefficiencies (sinkholes) that could tank team strategy\n",
    "3. **Injury Patterns by Age and Position:**\n",
    "   - Visualizations like boxplots, violin plots, and grouped bar charts illustrated clear differences between pitcher and position player injury occurrences\n",
    "   - Identified specific age ranges where injuries are more common, offering insight into team makeup vulnerabilities and longevity trends\n",
    "4. **Temporal Trends in Injury Data:**\n",
    "   - Also in the injury patterns chart, the monthly time series analysis shows seasonal patterns and gradual shifts in injury frequency\n",
    "   - Give temporal context to injury data, allowing for planning for future seasons\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Directions:\n",
    "1. **Deeper Analysis:**\n",
    "   - We could include more granular performance metrics, a deeper dive into specific injury types and their long-term effects, or even ***create*** new metrics\n",
    "   - We could use predictive modeling to attempt to forecast injury risks or performance trends based on historical data\n",
    "   - We could see how age and injuries play into contract valuation as far as extreme value or extreme sinkhole status\n",
    "2. **Enhanced Interactivity:**\n",
    "   - Future iterations can incorporate additional filters, more sophisticated user controls, or even real-time data updates\n",
    "   - Technology advancements could provide further insights and usability of the chart which we don't have availability at this moment\n",
    "3. **Broader Applications:**\n",
    "   - Other sports, business contract/performance valuations, health and fitness domains\n",
